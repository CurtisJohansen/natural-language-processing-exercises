       " 'content': 'Happy Pride Month! Pride Month is a dedicated time to celebrate and support the LGBTQIA+ community. At Codeup, one of our core values is Cultivating Inclusive Growth, something that takes on many shapes, sizes, forms, and colors. From representation in tech to empowering and supporting all, let’s reflect on how we live out this core value for our LGBTQIA+ community, not just during Pride Month, but always. We’re firm believers that the people making tech should look like the people using it, which is everyone. We’re proud to offer Pride Scholarships year round, which aim to increase, support, and promote representation of the LGBTQIA+ community in tech. However, representation is only one part of cultivating inclusive growth. We want to help create a thriving tech community where everyone feels represented, but also safe and empowered. In a 2019 survey conducted by Blind, 83% of LGBQ technologists and 78% of trans or gender non-conforming technologists reported that they felt safe in the workplace. In 2020, those numbers dropped to 76% and 64%, respectively. Why the drop? Maybe recent pushes for representation in tech weren’t followed up with efforts to truly cultivate inclusivity and growth. To cultivate inclusive growth, we don’t stop at representation. We also empower and support our community so that no one feels unsafe. Our internal DEI Taskforce empowers our staff with resources and conversations that aim to create a diverse culture of support, safety, and inclusivity for each other and our students. Equipped with this knowledge, our staff can cultivate inclusive growth from the first time they interact with an applicant all the way until they get placed into a new job. They may have even felt empowered just by seeing our students and staff sporting their Pride t-shirts around town. You can get yours on our merch store! The proceeds support our Pride Scholarship. Not only do we want the people making tech to look like the people using it, we also want them to feel safe and empowered to do so. If you’re looking for a career in tech, let us empower you every step of the way! First, apply now. Then, apply for our Pride Scholarship.'}"
